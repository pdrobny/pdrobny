## Hi there, I'm Paul!

- 👋 I’m a Semiconductor Engineer with a passion for data analysis and data-driven decision making. Over the years, I've honed my skills in ensuring the highest quality standards in semiconductor manufacturing, but what truly excites me is diving deep into data to uncover insights and drive improvements.
- 🔍 My favorite part of my experience has always been working with data. Whether it's designing and analyzing process experiments, identifying trends, setting up KPI dashboards, or making data-driven decisions to enhance product quality, I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights.
- 🚀 Now, I'm eager to shift my career towards data science and analysis, where I can focus even more on my passion for data. I'm currently expanding my skill set in data science, machine learning, and advanced analytics to make this transition.
